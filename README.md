## Installation

- [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/datalayer-explorer/akeipgacajnejdmcdmjcilfmhmaejjoe)

## Development

This extension is built with simplicity and transparency in mind. The source code is written in vanilla JavaScript and utilizes Chrome APIs directly, without the use of bundlers or frameworks. This approach ensures that the code you see in the repository is identical to what is deployed to the Chrome Web Store, facilitating easier review, modification, and understanding of the extension's functionality.

- `background.js`: Serves as the extension's service worker, responsible for updating the browser icon based on the presence of the `dataLayer` for the currently viewed site.
- `popup.html` / `popup.js`: Provides the user interface for debugging and interacting with the `dataLayer`.
- `contentScript.js`: Facilitates communication between `background.js` and `popup.html`, detecting when the `dataLayer` is present and relaying the events pushed to it.
- `init.js`: Loaded by `contentScript.js`, this script captures dataLayer events and sends them back to `contentScript.js`. This is necessary because `contentScript.js` lacks direct access to the window object and relies on these events when requested by `popup.html`.

### Setup

Install the extension from the [./src](./src) directory as an unpacked extension by following the instructions outlined in [this guide](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world#load-unpacked).

### popup.html / popup.js

The extension provides a streamlined development process for the popup interface by utilizing a development server. When the `ENVIRONMENT` constant is set to `development` (which is done by the server), this setup allows developers to work without relying on Chrome APIs and instead uses simulated event data in place of actual dataLayer events. This approach enables efficient testing and iteration without the need to constantly close and reopen the extension.

#### Setup

1. Install the supported `Node.js` version using [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

```bash
nvm install
```

2. Install dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server.

```bash
npm run start
```

4. Navigate to http://localhost:8100.

5. Start editing `popup.html` / `popup.js` in the [./src](./src) directory.
