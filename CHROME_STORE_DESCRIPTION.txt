Access detailed data effortlessly
View a comprehensive list of events (events pushed to window.dataLayer and Matomo), each expandable to reveal full event payloads and metadata. The intuitive interface allows for quick navigation through events so important insights are easily accessible.

Identify events quickly
Visual badges mark the source of each event — events pushed to `window.dataLayer` (e.g. Google Analytics or other systems that use dataLayer) or Matomo (from `window._mtm`) — making it simpler to focus on relevant data.

Facilitate sharing
The "Copy" function enables easy copying of event details to the clipboard for quick access or sharing with team members, streamlining collaboration and reporting.

Analyze event timing precisely
Hover an event to see the time elapsed since page load. This helps diagnose when events fire during the page lifecycle and supports troubleshooting and optimization.

Stay updated with ease
A refresh button lets you manually update the events list to pick up newly pushed events without reloading the page.

Supported systems
- Events pushed to window.dataLayer (e.g. Google Analytics 4 and other tools that push to dataLayer).
- Matomo — events pushed to window._mtm (Matomo).
